"How to fix a flat tire with Scrader Value: Push down on the valve pin with something thin enough to fit in that won't break off. If you can push the tire bead off the rim with your thumbs without using tire levers, do so. If not, use tire levers by inserting a lever with the scoop towards you between the rim sidewall and the tire until you catch the edge of the tire bead. Pry down on the lever until the bead is pulled out over the rim. Place the next lever a few inches away and do the same thing.")
